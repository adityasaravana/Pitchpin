DSWaveformImage - iOS & macOS realtime audio waveform rendering
===============
[![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/spm-compatible-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org/package-manager)

DSWaveformImage offers a native interfaces for drawing the envelope waveform of audio data 
in **iOS**, **iPadOS**, **macOS** or via Catalyst. To do so, you can use

* [`WaveformImageView`](Sources/DSWaveformImageViews/UIKit/WaveformImageView.swift) (UIKit) / [`WaveformView`](Sources/DSWaveformImageViews/SwiftUI/WaveformView.swift) (SwiftUI) to render a static waveform from an audio file or 
* [`WaveformLiveView`](Sources/DSWaveformImageViews/UIKit/WaveformLiveView.swift) (UIKit) / [`WaveformLiveCanvas`](Sources/DSWaveformImageViews/SwiftUI/WaveformLiveCanvas.swift) (SwiftUI) to realtime render a waveform of live audio data (e.g. from `AVAudioRecorder`)
* `WaveformImageDrawer` to generate a waveform `UIImage` from an audio file

Additionally, you can get a waveform's (normalized) `[Float]` samples directly as well by
creating an instance of `WaveformAnalyzer`.

Example UI (included in repository)
------------

For a practical real-world example usage of a SwiftUI live audio recording waveform rendering, see [RecordingIndicatorView](Example/DSWaveformImageExample-iOS/SwiftUIExample/SwiftUIExampleView.swift).

If you really like this library (aka Sponsoring)
------------
I'm doing all this for fun and joy and because I strongly believe in the power of open source. On the off-chance though, that using my library has brought joy to you and you just feel like saying "thank you", I would smile like a 4-year old getting a huge ice cream cone, if you'd support my via one of the sponsoring buttons ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï

If you're feeling in the mood of sending someone else a lovely gesture of appreciation, maybe check out my iOS app [üíå SoundCard](https://www.soundcard.io) to send them a real postcard with a personal audio message.

Installation
------------

* use SPM: add `https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage` and set "Up to Next Major" with "13.0.0"

```swift
import DSWaveformImage // for core classes to generate `UIImage` / `NSImage` directly
import DSWaveformImageViews // if you want to use the native UIKit / SwiftUI views
```

**Deprecated or discouraged** but still possible alternative ways for older apps:

* since it has no other dependencies you may simply copy the `Sources` folder directly into your project
* use carthage: `github "dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage" ~> 7.0` (last supported version is 10)
* or, sunset since 6.1.1: ~~use cocoapods: `pod 'DSWaveformImage', '~> 6.1'`~~

Usage
-----

`DSWaveformImage` provides 3 kinds of tools to use
* native SwiftUI views - [SwiftUI example usage code](Example/DSWaveformImageExample-iOS/SwiftUIExample/SwiftUIExampleView.swift)
* native UIKit views - [UIKit example usage code](Example/DSWaveformImageExample-iOS/ViewController.swift)
* access to the raw renderes and processors

The core renderes and processors as well as SwiftUI views natively support iOS & macOS, using `UIImage` & `NSImage` respectively.

### SwiftUI

#### `WaveformView` - renders a one-off waveform from an audio file:

```swift
@State var audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
WaveformView(audioURL: audioURL)
```

#### `WaveformLiveCanvas` - renders a live waveform from `(0...1)` normalized samples:

```swift
@StateObject private var audioRecorder: AudioRecorder = AudioRecorder() // just an example
WaveformLiveCanvas(samples: audioRecorder.samples)
```

### UIKit

#### `WaveformImageView` - renders a one-off waveform from an audio file:

```swift
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformImageView = WaveformImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 500, height: 300)
waveformImageView.waveformAudioURL = audioURL
```

#### `WaveformLiveView` - renders a live waveform from `(0...1)` normalized samples:

Find a full example in the [sample project's RecordingViewController](Example/DSWaveformImageExample-iOS/RecordingViewController.swift).

```swift
let waveformView = WaveformLiveView()

// configure and start AVAudioRecorder
let recorder = AVAudioRecorder()
recorder.isMeteringEnabled = true // required to get current power levels

// after all the other recording (omitted for focus) setup, periodically (every 20ms or so):
recorder.updateMeters() // gets the current value
let currentAmplitude = 1 - pow(10, recorder.averagePower(forChannel: 0) / 20)
waveformView.add(sample: currentAmplitude)
```

### Raw API

#### Configuration

*Note:* Calculations are always performed and returned on a background thread, so make sure to return to the main thread before doing any UI work.

Check `Waveform.Configuration` in [WaveformImageTypes](./Sources/DSWaveformImage/WaveformImageTypes.swift) for various configuration options.

#### `WaveformImageDrawer` - creates a `UIImage` waveform from an audio file:

```swift
let waveformImageDrawer = WaveformImageDrawer()
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformImageDrawer.waveformImage(fromAudioAt: audioURL, with: .init(
                                  size: topWaveformView.bounds.size,
                                  style: .filled(UIColor.black)),
                                  renderer: LinearWaveformRenderer()) { image in
    // need to jump back to main queue
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.topWaveformView.image = image
    }
}
```

#### `WaveformAnalyzer` - calculates an audio file's waveform sample:

```swift
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example_sound", withExtension: "m4a")!
waveformAnalyzer = WaveformAnalyzer(audioAssetURL: audioURL)
waveformAnalyzer.samples(count: 200) { samples in
    print("so many samples: \(samples)")
}
```

### `async` / `await` Support

The public API has been updated in 9.1 to support `async` / `await`. See the example app for an illustration.

```swift
public class WaveformAnalyzer {
    func samples(count: Int, qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .userInitiated) async throws -> [Float]
}

public class WaveformImageDrawer {
    public func waveformImage(
        fromAudioAt audioAssetURL: URL,
        with configuration: Waveform.Configuration,
        qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass = .userInitiated
    ) async throws -> UIImage
}
```


### Playback Progress Indication

If you're playing back audio files and would like to indicate the playback progress to your users, you can [find inspiration in the example app](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Example/DSWaveformImageExample-iOS/ProgressViewController.swift). UIKit and SwiftUI examples are provided.

Both approaches will result in something like the image below. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="./Promotion/progress-example.png" height="200" alt="playback progress waveform">
</div>


There is currently no plan to integrate this as a 1st class citizen to the library itself, as every app will have different design requirements, and `WaveformImageDrawer` as well as `WaveformAnalyzer` are as simple to use as the views themselves as you can see in the examples.

### Loading remote audio files from URL

For one example way to display waveforms for audio files on remote URLs see https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/issues/22.

What it looks like
------------------

Waveforms can be rendered in 2 different ways and 5 different styles each.

By default [`LinearWaveformRenderer`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Sources/DSWaveformImage/Renderers/LinearWaveformRenderer.swift) is used, which draws a linear 2D amplitude envelope.

[`CircularWaveformRenderer`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Sources/DSWaveformImage/Renderers/CircularWaveformRenderer.swift) is available as an alternative, which can be passed in to the `WaveformView` or `WaveformLiveView` respectively. It draws a circular
2D amplitude envelope.

You can implement your own renderer by implementing [`WaveformRenderer`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Sources/DSWaveformImage/Renderers/WaveformRenderer.swift).
 
The following styles can be applied to either renderer:
 - **filled**: Use solid color for the waveform.
 - **outlined**: Draws the envelope as an outline with the provided thickness.
 - **gradient**: Use gradient based on color for the waveform.
 - **gradientOutlined**: Use gradient based on color for the waveform. Draws the envelope as an outline with the provided thickness.
 - **striped**: Use striped filling based on color for the waveform.

Migration
---------
### In 13.0.0
* Any mentions of `dampening` & similar were corrected to `damping` etc in [11460b8b](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/commit/11460b8b8203f163868ba774d1533116d2fe68a1). Most notably in `Waveform.Configuration`. See [#64](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/issues/64). 
* styles `.outlined` & `.gradientOutlined` were added to `Waveform.Style`, see https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage#what-it-looks-like
* `Waveform.Position` was removed. If you were using it to place the view somewhere, move this responsibility up to its parent for positioning, like with any other view as well.

### In 12.0.0
* The rendering pipeline was split out from the analysis. You can now create your own renderes by subclassing [`WaveformRenderer`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Sources/DSWaveformImage/Renderers/WaveformRenderer.swift).
* A new [`CircularWaveformRenderer`](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/blob/main/Sources/DSWaveformImage/Renderers/CircularWaveformRenderer.swift) has been added.
* `position` was removed from `Waveform.Configuration`, see [0447737](https://github.com/dmrschmidt/DSWaveformImage/commit/044773782092becec0424527f6feef061988db7a).
* new `Waveform.Style` option have been added and need to be accounted for in `switch` statements etc.

### In 11.0.0 
the library was split into two: `DSWaveformImage` and `DSWaveformImageViews`. If you've used any of the native views bevore, just add the additional `import DSWaveformImageViews`.
The SwiftUI views have changed from taking a Binding to the respective plain values instead.

### In 9.0.0 
a few public API's have been slightly changed to be more concise. All types have also been grouped under the `Waveform` enum-namespace. Meaning `WaveformConfiguration` for instance has become `Waveform.Configuration` and so on.

### In 7.0.0 
colors have moved into associated values on the respective `style` enum.

`Waveform` and the `UIImage` category have been removed in 6.0.0 to simplify the API.
See `Usage` for current usage.
