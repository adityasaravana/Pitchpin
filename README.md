Pitchpin is an open-source audio recorder app, like Voice Memos, with timestamping, so you can mark important moments while recording and come back to them later.

Thanks to "Umayanga Alahakoon" for his VoiceRecTest app, which was used as a base for Pitchpin's playback capabilities and provided a skeleton UI for Pitchpin, and thanks to the creators of DSWaveformImage for the nice waveform displayed on Pitchpin's recording UI.
